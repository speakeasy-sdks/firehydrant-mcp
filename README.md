## Installation

<details>
<summary>DXT (Desktop Extension)</summary>

Install the MCP server as a Desktop Extension using the pre-built [`mcp-server.dxt`](./mcp-server.dxt) file:

Simply drag and drop the [`mcp-server.dxt`](./mcp-server.dxt) file onto Claude Desktop to install the extension.

The DXT package includes the MCP server and all necessary configuration. Once installed, the server will be available without additional setup.

> [!NOTE]
> DXT (Desktop Extensions) provide a streamlined way to package and distribute MCP servers. Learn more about [Desktop Extensions](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/desktop-extensions).

Or manually:

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Select Tools and Integrations
3. Select New MCP Server
4. If the configuration file is empty paste the following JSON into the MCP Server Configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "FireHydrant": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "firehydrant-mcp",
        "start",
        "--api-key",
        "..."
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Claude Code CLI</summary>

```bash
npx firehydrant-mcp start --api-key ...
```

<details>
<summary>Claude Desktop</summary>
Claude Desktop doesn't yet support SSE/remote MCP servers.

However, you can run the MCP server locally by cloning this repository. Once cloned, you'll need to install dependencies (`npm install`) and build the server (`npm run build`).

Then, configure your server definition to reference your local clone. For example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "FireHydrant": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "./bin/mcp-server.js",
        "start",
        "--api-key",
        "..."
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
